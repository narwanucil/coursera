author: NARWAN GINANJAR



Introduction
========================================================
The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better apartment, neighborhood in a new city for the person who are shifting there. Social presence in society in terms of like minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby.

The key question is:    
How can we find a convenient and enjoyable place similar to current you are living? Certainly, We can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, we must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:

Data Description
========================================================
The following data is required to answer the issues of the problem:

1. List of Boroughs and neighborhoods of Manhattan with their geodata (latitude and longitude)    
2. List of Subway metro stations in Manhattan with their address location   
3. List of apartments for rent in Manhattan area with their addresses and price   
4. Preferably, a list of apartment for rent with additional information, such as price, address, area, numbers of beds, etc    
5.Venues for each Manhattan neighborhood ( than can be clustered)   
6. Venues for subway metro stations, as needed   


Methodology
========================================================

The tools described are used here and the Notebook cells indicates the execution of steps. The processing of these data will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:

1. What is the cost of rent (per square ft) around a mile radius from each subway metro station?   
2. What is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?    
3. What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future home?    
4. What are the venues of the two best places to live? How the prices compare?    
5. How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?   
6. Are there trade-offs between size and price and location?    
7. Any other interesting statistical data findings of the real estate and overall data.
